# Railway Deployment Guide for AI-Driven Public Health Chatbot

## ðŸš€ Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Prerequisites
- Railway account (https://railway.app)
- GitHub repository with your code
- API keys for external services

### 2. Deploy to Railway

#### Option A: One-Click Deploy
[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template?template=https://github.com/Anasgaima18/AI-Driven-Public-Health-Chatbot-for-Disease-Awareness)

```bash
# Test Action Server
curl https://your-action-server-url.railway.app/health-check

# Test Rasa Server
curl https://your-rasa-server-url.railway.app/status

# Test Web Dashboard
open https://your-web-dashboard-url.railway.app
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Model Training Timeout**: Increase Railway build timeout
2. **Memory Issues**: Upgrade to Pro plan for more RAM
3. **API Rate Limits**: Monitor usage and upgrade plans if needed

### Logs:
Check Railway logs in the dashboard for each service to debug issues.

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Scaling

### Health Checks:
- All services have health check endpoints
- Automatic restarts on failures
- Real-time monitoring in Railway dashboard

### Scaling:
- Start with Hobby plan ($5/month)
- Upgrade to Pro ($10/month) for more resources
- Use Railway's auto-scaling features

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets to code
2. **API Keys**: Rotate regularly, use restricted permissions
3. **Network Security**: Railway provides automatic SSL/TLS
4. **Access Control**: Configure proper authentication for admin endpoints

## ðŸŒŸ Production Optimizations

1. **Caching**: Implement Redis for session storage
2. **CDN**: Use Railway's built-in CDN for static assets
3. **Database**: Use Railway's PostgreSQL for data persistence
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for critical metrics
